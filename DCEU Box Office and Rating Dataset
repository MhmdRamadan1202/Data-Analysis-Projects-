## When I looked for an DCEU datasets on Kaggle, I coudl not found a proper dataset for data analysis and visualization. Since a fan of DC Extended Universe (DCEU), I thought it would be a fun to create an DCEU box office and rating dataset. This dataset includes box office datas of all DCEU movies, release date, movie duration, movie budget, US Gross, Worldwide Gross, imdb score, metascore, tomatometer score, and tomatometer audience score.
